    Iâ€™m guessing that a buffer which only holds the current 8 bits would be enough to embed the values. 
    But it would require some form of position tracking. 
    
    A more efficient way to embed data could be to process each 8-bit chunk real-time
    as opposed to storing the entire value in a buffer. 
    We will process a single 8-bit chunk of data at a time, embed it and then continue to the next 8-bit chunk?
